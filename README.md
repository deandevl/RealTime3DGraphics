# RealTime3DGraphics
Contains WebGL based javascript examples from the book [Real-Time 3D Graphics with WebGL2](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/real-time-3d-graphics/9781788629690/) by Ghayour and Cantor.

The two main goals for this repository are to:

1. Complete the book's exercises with a minimum amount of resources and begin an understanding of the vast WebGL concepts.  In my opinion the book is excellent in getting to the point and the progression is well thought out.
2. To develop a set of javascript esm6 modules containing classes and functions that can assist in the programming of a WebGL application.  The repository [web-gl-helpers](https://github.com/deandevl/web-gl-helpers) is being developed as I continue my reading of this book and other sources.

To do a quick run on the applications contained here, do the following:

1. Install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

2. Install globally on your local computer [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server): `npm install --global http-server`.

3. Download and establish a directory for the content in this repository.

4. At a command prompt or terminal change directories to the root of the above directory.

5. Enter `http-server`. The server will respond that it is listening at port address 8080.

6. In the address block of a browser enter: `localhost::8080`. A directory tree should appear.

7. With your cursor go down through the tree and select an `index.html` file of interest.

   

Note: The large car model files used in the book are NOT part of this repository.  You will have to download them separately from the books [website](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/real-time-3d-graphics/9781788629690/).
